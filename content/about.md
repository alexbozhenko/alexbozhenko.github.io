Hi.
I'm Alex.

I'm passionate about open-source and Linux, with a particular interest in systems programming.  

I worked at Mirantis, Facebook, and Jane Street(a proprietary trading company in New York).  

In 2021, I took a year off to enroll in the phenomenal [Bradfield Computer Science Intensive](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/)  

I am currently working at Pinterest.

#### Hiring me

Iâ€™m open to full-time, short-time and part-time opportunities.
