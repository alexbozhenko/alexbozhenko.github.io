[blog post "Error handling and Go"](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20error%20implementation%E2%80%99s%20responsibility%20to%20summarize%20the%20context.%20The%20error%20returned%20by%20os.Open%20formats%20as%20%E2%80%9Copen%20/etc/passwd%3A%20permission%20denied%2C%E2%80%9D%20not%20just%20%E2%80%9Cpermission%20denied.%E2%80%9D)

mentions:

> It is the error implementation’s responsibility to summarize the context. The error returned by os.Open formats as “open /etc/passwd: permission denied,” not just “permission denied.”
